                                <p>NEET is a leveling test to analyze a candidate's ability to study MBBS. It also prohibits private universities from conducting their own entrance exams, and candidates do not have to take multiple entrance exams to get admission to the university. Both public and private universities award admission based on NEET scores. The definition depends on the university. A minimum NEET qualification is required to enroll in MBBS abroad.

                                <p>Many agents are disseminating false information about Georgia. This is because they are not working with MBBS Universities in Georgia. Therefore, they hurt MBBS studies in Georgia to send students to  Ukraine or Russia. But in reality, Georgia is a much better destination for medical research than Russia or Ukraine. Most universities in Russia offer bilingual medical research. However, Indian agents do not share this information with students. Therefore, students going to Russia will be taught in Russian during the last three years of the MBBS course. This undermines students' understanding and they are unable to properly grasp the information. Similarly, Ukrainian medical colleges have a low level of education. University professors ask students for money to carry over to the next semester. This allows students to complete the exam without studying. Students who can afford to pay the professor pass the exam without studying. Therefore, this discourages students from learning. There is also a tension between Russia and Ukraine, and the location is unsuitable and unsafe for students. Unless the problem between Russia and Ukraine is resolved, we encourage Indian students not to miss a chance and continue their medical research there.  Georgia is a much better destination for MBBS research. The quality of education in Georgia is unmatched in countries like Russia and Ukraine. In fact,  Georgia is the  best destination to study MBBS after China.
